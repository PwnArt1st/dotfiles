Vox Beatles Mystery Presets

<<INFO>> 
Enough heavy presets! Here is ten presets for Guitarix, which use Gain, GxSuppaTonebender and GxVmk2 (which you will have to compile) to produce some guitar timbres similar to those used by the fab four between 1966-68. Vox built the transistor preamp loaded 730 amp in 1965, and late in 1966 the very similar all-transistor Conqueror. Both were used by the Beatles.
The GxVmk2 emulates the preamp stage of the Vox Conqueror amp, and is here used to emulate some classic guitar tone from 1966, 1967 and 1968.
As the presets are voiced as an effects frontend for a real amp, you will have to add at least a cab emulation in series - either a 2x12 or 4x12. And be sure to adjust input gain, as the sound really depends on the right input levels.
Sounds are 1. Clean, 2. Rain, 3. Paperback Writer, 4. Paperback Rythm, 5. She Said, 6. Taxman, 7. Hello Goodbye, 8. Flying, 9. Savoy Truffle, 0. Birthday.

UPDATED! NEW twin, twin 2 and blues 3. Vintage 70's rock sound for hard rock. Jazz and modern jazz. Blues and blues 2. ATTENTION, the adjustment of the input level of the sound card. High level created a bad distortion. Low level, you do not have the right answer of the guitar. For best sound set the sample rate to 48 kHz frame 128, the buffer 2  . If you like, to give me a star, a stimulus for making new presets. Have fun...........

It is mild preset with the multiband distortion. So sounds clean and a bit rougher, if you play louder.

Darlings.gx.Last update July 2016. Enhanced and improved.Clean (cl), crunchy (cr) and overdriven (od) guitarix sets of Roland JC-120, Voxes, Fenders, Marshall JCM-800, Mesa Boogie.The clean sounds with reverb (rv) and a bit chorus (ch). The overdriven sounds sometimes with compression (co).Normally I prefer the tonestack, but sometimes the amp impulse seems to do a better job. Try it yourself. And try putting it in front of or behind the valve section. It sounds different!Kept simple. Just Valve - Amp Impulse or Tonestack - Reverb - Chorus - Cabinet. Now (July 2016) with tremolo Fenders.

Journey Guitarix Preset
<<FILE>> 
https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/249/journey.gx
<<INFO>> 
I decided to call this preset "Journey" because I was fooling around trying to get a guitar tone like in the Journey song "I'll be alright without you", just like my client requested. Typical bluesy 80's Fender sound.

Then as it turns out, with a bit of Convolver and Delay the tone sounds quite like a "mystical" trip to me. So the name "Journey" still works in that situation :)

This demo was played on my Epiphone Explorer with humbucker on the neck pickup.

A Guitarix preset for a clean guitar sound with an edge of overdrive. Sounds awesome for clean leads, rhythmic passages and funky guitar stuff.

Turn the plate reverb off if you want a more raw sound.

EDIT:

Updated with a version for Humbuckers and another one with a cleaner sound with a little more delay and reverb.

Deadhead preset
<<FILE>> 
https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/149/Deadhead.gx
<<INFO>> 
A guitarix preset for the song Deadhead by the canadian metal master Devin Townsend. It's very noisy and you should tweak the reverb and the delay to suit your needs.

The original recording has lots of layers of guitars and reverb so this is not really a reproduction of that tone, just something you can use for fun and to build upon. Also my guitar and strings dont really suit this riff, but I've recorded the demo sounds anyway.  It's also pretty good for lead sounds!

Included are two presets, 'Deadhead' and 'Deadhead Dry' which is just the original preset but without the heavy reverb and delay.

Have fun and remember: always pick down for extra heavyness ;)

I'm playing some songs from a german metal band called Running Wild.

I think I have put together a tone in guitarix which fits these songs quite well, at least for me.

The preset consists of the following elements:


Main setting: 12ax7, full Pre-Gain but without Presence.
Tonestack: Fender with about 70% bass and some Middle.
Cabinet: Mesa Boogie with 50% bass and 50% treble.

British Sounds Pack

<<INFO>> 
there are lots and lots of brilliant Hi- Gain distortion patches, but I still haven't found what I was looking for ... :P

So, what I want is the feeling of standing in front of at least a true British half-stack, with
all the dirt I need, but also some dynamics so I can turn down the volume on my guitar, play some nice
and gentle notes and chords, then turning up again and making the whole thing roar ...
Kind of back to the ancient days ...

OK, so I'm doing some experiments now.
I got an 1980 Ibanez Artist, orginal pickups, running into a Fasttrack, then a Lenovo B560. Here I have
Ubuntu studio with Jack, Guitarix, Ardour, all the fine stuff.
And I'm using desktop speakers and a headphone.

The patches attached are very basic - not many effects, most of them just with a little ambient, so I can use
them as a starting point for other stuff. (I'm not happy with the clean ones at all, so please ignore them)
They are also not very different from each other, just different flavours or different drive.

an overly distorted lead sound
