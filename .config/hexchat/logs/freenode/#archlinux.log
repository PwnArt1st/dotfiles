Feb 24 21:29:57 <avrelaun>	krarkrrrc: just your config ?
Feb 24 21:30:02 <avrelaun>	krarkrrrc: or all files ?
Feb 24 21:30:05 <krarkrrrc>	everything
Feb 24 21:30:06 <alwyn>	I'd do explicit inclusion instead of implicit "everything"
Feb 24 21:30:19 <avrelaun>	do not recommend that
Feb 24 21:30:27 <avrelaun>	a lot of files change
Feb 24 21:30:33 <krarkrrrc>	i know thats why im asking how to do it efficiently
Feb 24 21:30:50 <avrelaun>	krarkrrrc: I'm currently doing it, but only in my .config folder
Feb 24 21:31:01 <krarkrrrc>	i want to create a troubleshooting layer that i can easily see if a file has changed and can catch bugs that way
Feb 24 21:31:18 <krarkrrrc>	actually if i could get it for the entire / that would be even better
Feb 24 21:31:20 <alwyn>	avrelaun: exactly. So you should only include the files you want, not include everything automatically :P (git add .)

Feb 24 21:32:01 <krarkrrrc>	yea but if you have a git repo inside a git repo, theres a conflict

Feb 24 21:32:12 <alwyn>	krarkrrrc: maybe you need something like puppet?

Feb 24 21:32:24 <alwyn>	Then you can put your puppet code in git :thinking:
Feb 24 21:32:26 <awal>	maybe you need to be careful
Feb 24 21:32:36 <alwyn>	And that.
Feb 24 21:32:36 <krarkrrrc>	no thats a horrible idea
Feb 24 21:32:53 <alwyn>	krarkrrrc: putting / in git is a horrible idea
Feb 24 21:32:58 <krarkrrrc>	agreed

Feb 24 21:33:38 <plow>	What does 'unsupported signature formatwarning' mean while installing from a third party repo. The package has been verified with pacman-key --verify before pacman -U
Feb 24 21:33:41 <awal>	~ contains ~/.cache which contains a ridiculously huge amount of bloat, tracking which with git is not going to end well
Feb 24 21:33:50 *	maolang has quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
Feb 24 21:34:13 <avrelaun>	krarkrrrc: that's why I have a git repo for .config and not home
Feb 24 21:34:44 <krarkrrrc>	heres my reasoning: to move forward at any reasonable pace in tech, me must use other peoples code, code that we dont intimately understand, therefore a way to profile files is justified
Feb 24 21:34:46 *	maolang (~quassel@vil93-5-82-230-197-98.fbx.proxad.net) has joined
Feb 24 21:35:17 <avrelaun>	krarkrrrc: if you need some others folders outside .config
Feb 24 21:35:21 <avrelaun>	just symlink them
Feb 24 21:35:53 <krarkrrrc>	the problem with that approach is it assumes you know where the problems will be to begin with
Feb 24 21:36:04 *	Keniyal has quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
Feb 24 21:36:06 <krarkrrrc>	so you have to have a problem from there to know to include it

Feb 24 21:37:22 <mkoskar>	krarkrrrc: there is a gitignore * trick punching holes to what you need then gitignore !/... them back or just force add, that's how I do it for ~/ and /etc ... works ok
Feb 24 21:37:56 <krarkrrrc>	mkoskar: you have / in a repo?

Feb 24 21:39:03 <krarkrrrc>	and obviously yea, if youre 'careful' you can avoid all this, but being careful assumes youve learned enough to know where to be careful, in which case you dont save any time
Feb 24 21:39:23 *	kelvan has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Feb 24 21:39:44 <mkoskar>	not saying I recommend it, or that it is ideal but I wanted something simple to start tracking files without making it complicated with symlinks or some other tools, turns out 3/4 years later I'm still at this :)

Feb 24 21:43:13 <krarkrrrc>	thats a huge leak
Feb 24 21:45:08 *	turlando (~turlando@151.64.31.132) has joined
Feb 24 21:45:16 <krarkrrrc>	and this type of problem will only get worse since we have to rely more and more on other peoples code
Feb 24 21:45:24 <mkoskar>	krarkrrrc: well, that's the point of tracking ... I see the changes with git stat, as for commits I'm constantly tinkering with some homefiles so I was some changes all the time, but I usually don't commit them separately but rewind one commit git reset --soft HEAD~1 and commit again, then once upon a time I push it

Feb 24 22:56:06 <Quetzal>	akaWolf: Too bad. Strange because it comes from LxQt and they must have a system tray somehow.
Feb 24 22:56:14 <nnscr>	xoan, alternatives?
Feb 24 22:56:20 <xoan>	pronterface
Feb 24 22:56:30 <pwnart1st>	want to have $files contain the names of all files excluding ignored
Feb 24 22:56:38 <krarkrrrc>	i cant figure out how to exclude a folder in .gitignore, only the file matching patterns are working: https://ptpb.pw/2zdO
Feb 24 22:56:47 <nnscr>	xoan, i'll give it a try, thanks
Feb 24 22:57:07 <pwnart1st>	krarkrrrc, i just do like ./folder ./folder/ ./folder/*
